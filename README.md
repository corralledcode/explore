Flagcalc Explore
================

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Download the explore binaries (that include the 
command line tool flagcalc).
Unzip both to a folder of your choice, e.g. "~/flagcalc"
The unzipped packages will populate subdirectories "bin", 
"scripts", "python", "documentation", and "testgraphs".

In the root directory (suggested above, "flagcalc"), edit the
file fcexplore.cfg if desired, to have the correct paths to
the flagcalc executable and to the default directory (usually "scripts").
